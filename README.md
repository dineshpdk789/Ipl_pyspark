## About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing [Indian Premier League (IPL)](https://www.iplt20.com/) data using **[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)** on **[Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)**. The workflow leverages **[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)** for data storage, **Spark** for data transformation, and **SQL analytics** for querying and insights. The final results are visualized to derive meaningful insights from IPL match and player data.

### Key Components :

-   **Data Storage** : IPL dataset is stored in **Amazon S3** for scalable and reliable access.
    
-   **Transformation** : Apache Spark is used to process and transform raw IPL data.
    
-   **SQL Analytics** : Structured queries help extract valuable statistics and trends.
    
-   **Visualization** : Analytical insights are represented using charts and graphs.
    
<br>

This end-to-end data pipeline enables deep analysis of IPL statistics, including player performance, team trends, and match outcomes. The project demonstrates the power of **big data processing** with **Databricks and Apache Spark**.
